# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Lab — Java (JDK 21+)

This repository contains a structured collection of laboratory exercises completed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course, implemented in **Java (JDK 21+)**.

The focus of this repository is deliberate practice of core OOP principles through incremental, hands-on problem solving. Each lab session builds on previous concepts, reinforcing both theoretical understanding and implementation discipline.

This repository is actively maintained and will continue evolving as additional labs and advanced topics are completed.

## Focus Areas

The work in this repository emphasizes:

* Object modeling and class design
* Constructor overloading and method structuring
* Encapsulation and data integrity
* Logical program flow and decision structures
* String and array manipulation
* Modular decomposition of problems
* Clean package-based organization
* Progressive complexity in program design

The intent is not just functional correctness, but clarity, structure, and maintainability.

## Technical Stack

* **Language:** Java
* **Runtime:** JDK 21+
* **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming
* **Build:** Standard `javac` workflow

---

## Philosophy

This repository represents deliberate skill-building rather than one-off assignments.
Each exercise is treated as an opportunity to:

* Strengthen conceptual foundations
* Improve code readability
* Develop disciplined structure
* Practice scalable thinking early

Foundational strength compounds.

## Status

Active and expanding.
Future labs will continue increasing in conceptual depth and implementation rigor.
